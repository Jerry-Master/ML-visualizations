# ML-visualizations

The aim of this project is to provide a tool for visualizing common ML concepts such as its layers. Right now, it only has a sketch of a page, with no useful visualization. 

## In-process

The results are expected to show something similar to these:

### Computation in MLPs: hidden units

### Computation in MLPs: full network

## Usage

To see the page you can download the package and all its content and execute index.html locally. In the future there may be a real page with all the visualizations inside. 

## Coding language

The first sketch are visualized through P5.js, a library of JavaScript. It is no more than a square where anything can be implemented. We will also work with python to make the calculations and export some premade visualizations.
